    "Preprocessing data for a machine learning model involves both data engineering and feature engineering. During data engineering, we convert raw data into prepared data which is necessary for the model. Feature engineering then takes that prepared data and creates the features expected by the model. We have already seen various ways we can engineer new features for a machine learning model and where those steps take place. We also have flexibility as to where data preprocessing steps can take place; for example, BigQuery, Cloud Dataflow and Tensorflow. In this lab, we'll explore different data preprocessing strategies and see how they can be accomplished with Cloud Dataflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One perspective in which to categorize different types of data preprocessing operations is in terms of the granularity of the operation. Here, we will consider the following three types of operations:\n",
    "1. Instance-level transformations\n",
    "2. Full-pass transformations\n",
    "3. Time-windowed aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll say a few words about each of these below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Instance-level transformations**\n",
    "There are transformations which take place during training and prediction, looking only at values from a single data point. For example, they might include clipping the value of a feature, polynomially \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Full-pass transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Time-windowed aggregations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Dataflow can perform each of these types of operations and is particularly useful when performing computationally expensive operations as it is an autoscaling service for batch and streaming data processing pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a large part of applied machine learning is feature engineering. Many times that process of feature engineering involves transforming and/or augementing the source data to create features with more predictive power on the target. As is the case with most data science techniques, the appropriate selection and creation of these engineered features is guided by domain knowledge of the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data science practicioner, you have options for where and how to apply any feature engineering steps on the source data. One nice way to frame these different approaches is in terms of the granularity of the operations. That is, we can consider feature engineering operations as being instance-level, full-pass and/or time-windowed aggregations. "

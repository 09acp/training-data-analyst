    "\n",
    "The Estimator API way of doing this is to replace `estimator.train()` and `estimator.evaluate()` with `estimator.train_and_evaluate()`. This causes an evaluation to be done after every training checkpoint. However by default Tensorflow only checkpoints once every  10 minutes. Since this is less than the length of our total training we'd end up with the same behavior as before which is just one evaluation at the end of training. \n",

    "\n",
    "The default evaluation metric `average_loss` is MSE, but we want RMSE. Previously we just took the square root of the final `average_loss`. However it would be better if we could calculate RMSE not just at the end, but for every intermediate checkpoint and plot the change over time in TensorBoard. [`tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/add_metrics) allows us to do this. We wrap our estimator with it, and provide a custom evaluation function.\n",
